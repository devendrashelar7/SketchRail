# SketchRail
A Graphical User Interface for generating and viewing representations of railway networks. Helps generate test cases for rail scheduling. The core logic also consists of a simulator that can generate scheduling of passenger trains and cargo trains. The resulting output of trains can then be viewed on the GUI in the form of a simulation. The user can use a play and or fast-forward button to quickly visualize bottlenecks on the railway network caused due to railway congestion. This can help the user identify strategies for congestion mitigation, signal placement, rerouting of certain trains, capacity expansion of the network, etc.
